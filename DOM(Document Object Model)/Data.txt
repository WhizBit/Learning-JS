document.querySelector('h1')
Will give the first h1 present in the HTML 

With # we pass id and with . we pass class Name 

Can store it in a variable/constant and apply QuerySelector on that 

From HTML we get the NodeList of Elements using QuerySelectorAll, Cannot apply map on them like normal Array

document.getElementByClassName -> Gives HTML Collection
